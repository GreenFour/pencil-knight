DC1: this is where the issue occurs (note that Soldier and Dino's anims and hitboxes are perectly aligned,
as is Hero's when falling. It's the collision that needs to be updated.)

Original line was... this.y = this.boundY - (this.scale*this.spriteHeight - this.boundHeight);

Leaving it as above causes Hero to be drawn too high in relation to the hitbox.
I feel like the removal of the second term *should* perfectly realign, but obviously
there's something I'm not accounting for.
So far, my attempts to change the assignment for this.boundY (directly above the line I changed)
have caused issues. (I doubt we need to change it, because the hitbox is still colliding perfectly with the terrain.
this.y is what needs to be fixed).

DC2: this is the change that was made to Hero/Dino/Soldier/Hero projectiles, and will eventually be
the expression for the other non-terrain entities. It 

DC3: : subtracting by this value makes all frames align according to the base of the frame and not the top.
In other words, no matter a frame's height, the animation will align with other animations. (see soldier as
an example. Dino has a slight frame adjustment in spritesheet to make the shooting anims line up.)
