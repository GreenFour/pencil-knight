Controls and Basic Instructions:
    There are two different control layouts. Press Numpad 9 for layout A, and P for layout B.
    Control layout can be changed at any time during the game.

    Both layouts share the following controls:
    A - Move left
    D - Move right
    W - Energize
    Space - Jump

    The unique layout keys are as follows:
    For layout A (Numpad 9)
        Numpad 1 = dash,
        Numpad 4 = shoot,
        Numpad 5 = slash,
        Numpad 6 = cleave,
        
    For layout B (P)
        J = shoot,
        K = slash,
        L = cleave,
        M = dash,
        
How To Play
    The Hero, aka Pencil Knight, has two resources. Energy, and Health. Bars for these resources can be seen in the top left of the screen.
    Energy lets Pencil Knight perform special and enhanced actions.
        Hold W to "energize" PK.
        W + shoot: Stronger and faster shot.
        W + slash: A super powerful sword projectile. It's expensive, but it may save your life.
    
    Dash
        Dash is a great tool for moving around the map and avoiding damage. Dash also has a window of invulnerability. Use it to get around pesky enemies or incoming projectiles.
        Dash will always cost energy to use. (You didn't think we'd give you a tool like this without a cost, do you?)
        A grounded dash can be interrupted by using a slash attack. Use this to your advantage! All other actions are disabled during a dash.
    Jumping
        Like all great heros, Pencil Knight can jump! But can he jump twice?
        
    Enemies
        We recommend playing the game and learning through experience, but here are some helpful hints if you're having trouble:
        Soldier
            The Soldier can't be damaged from the front if he's holding up his shield. You'll have to get behind him to hit his back, or hit him during the startup or cooldown of one of his attacks.
        Dino
            The Dinosaur's energy ball will track you until it fizzles out, is hit by an attack, or hits some terrain. Rather than damaging you, it will prevent your energy from regenerating for a time.
        Crow
            Alone, the Crows are not too scary. Crows are never alone.
        Zombomber
            The Zombomber will throw damaging Bombs toward Pencil Knight. These bombs will not hurt you on contact, but if you're too close when the fuse is up, you'll regret it. Try shooting the bombs out of the air!
            A Zombomber can't be killed with plasma. You'll need to give it an up-close and personal look at your sword if you want to send it back from whence it came. Just be careful not to hit it while it's launching another bomb.
        Environmental Hazards
            If it looks like it will hurt you, you probably shouldn't touch it! This goes extra for lava. You didn't know it, but all your time playing "the floor is lava" as a kid was preparing you for this moment.
    Items 
        Items currently just restore your respective resources. Perhaps, if you keep coming back to play, you'll find that they do something a bit more interesting.
